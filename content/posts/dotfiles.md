//Dotfiles coming soon on Github. For now I guess this exists.

Currently taking a break from Distrohopping on Arch (obligatory btw). DWM, suckless of course, fullgaps and alpha patch, Dmenu, also suckless on a minimal Xorg base. St because I'm lazy. Blackarch is also cool, I've heard.

WP through Nitrogen, Ranger for ranging ;-;(iwm). Tor for free*er ranging. Nyx to help with that. Qutebrowser because I am lazy. Lynx for the vibes.

Dendron combined with VS Codium as a PKM. Picom as my compositor. 

Anki with approximately half a billion addons.  

Plover-git with the seperate plugin library and dnaqs HID Implementation because overengineering gives meaning in life. Adding on to that, DiDoes Vim Library.

Bluetoothctl, pipewire-alsa, usb-utils, and other boring things that I forget about until I need them.
 
Vim Binds. For Everything.

I still think of you pywal, one day I will meet you again. I may never forgive you for making ricing completely obsolete, but goddamn I love your schemes.

Always remember to :wq! kids, also wear your seatbelt.
